# Projects by Alexander Sproul
This repository is intended to showcase work that I've done involving code. The main purpose is to demonstrate the way that I think about problems, my coding style, and the way that I communicate my thought process to others. It is also intended to show my learning progress. Dates are typically included at the beginning of any code.
