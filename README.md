# Projects by Alexander Sproul
This repository is intended to showcase work that I've done involving code. The main purpose is to demonstrate the way that I think about problems, my coding style, and the way that I communicate my thought process to others. It is also intended to show my learning progress. Dates are typically included at the beginning of any code.

# About Me
My name is Alex. I have an honours degree in neuroscience from Acadia University. While I was writing my honours thesis, I had to teach myself my first programming language and learn how to code with R. It was one of the most difficult yet most rewarding experiences of my life and it paid off with a thesis that proposed a model of diagnosing dyslexia using eye movements. My research won an award of Academic Excellence from the Canadian Psychological Association when I graduated and I decided that to be successful as a neuroscientist, I needed to learn more about computers.

I am currently an Information Technology Data Analytics student at Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC). Since I began my program, I have tutored over 20 students in topics like mathematics, statistics, organization, programming, and relational database design. 

# Current Projects
This section outlines current projects I am working on but have not yet completed. It is intended to showcase my most current work and to provide a sense of my current interests.

## Brain-Computer Interfacing Applied Semester Project
Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) is the use of measured brain activities an a signal to interact with a digital environment. In other words, thoughts are used as a "controller" in a digital environment. BCIs are a new and exciting field of research in neuroscience and I have had to privilege of volunteering with a lab at Dalhousie University that attempted to create one. Most BCIs use brain data collected using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG places electrodes on a person's scalp which read the summed electrical potential of the person's brain activity. 

As an Applied Semester Project at NSCC, I am working with one other student to compare two different statistical learning models applied to open-source EEG data. The paradigm asked participants to imagine a motor movement (e.g., squeezing their right hand) while their brain activity was measured, and classified the patterns as a signal to interact with the environment. The goal of the project is to  compare the use of Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines as classification models for this dataset and evaluate which method will provide more robust predictions. 

## Mental Wellness Database
Mental wellness is a psychological construct describing the healthiness of a person's mental state (as opposed to mental illness which typically lies on the low-end of a mental wellness spectrum). I am currently working on a project designing a relational database for a mental wellness evaluation. When the evaluation is filled out, the database will store the user's results and be used to provide an immediate visualization of their mental state, based on a five-dimensional model of mental wellness. The project is currently at a very early stage but requires the application of many skills I have learned from the Data Analytics program at NSCC and combines it with my education in psychology.
