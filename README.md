# Projects by Alexander Sproul
This repository is intended to showcase work that I've done involving code. The main purpose is to demonstrate the way that I think about problems, my coding style, and the way that I communicate my thought process to others. It is also intended to show my learning progress. Dates are typically included at the beginning of any code.

# About Me
My name is Alex. I have an honours degree in neuroscience from Acadia University. While I was writing my honours thesis, I had to teach myself my first programming language and learn how to code with R. It was one of the most difficult yet most rewarding experiences of my life and it paid off with a thesis that proposed a model of diagnosing dyslexia using eye movements. My research won an award of Academic Excellence from the Canadian Psychological Association when I graduated and I decided that to be successful as a neuroscientist, I needed to learn more about computers.

I am currently an Information Technology Data Analytics student at Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC). Since I began my program, I have tutored over 20 students in topics like mathematics, statistics, organization, programming, and relational database design. 

# Current Projects
This section outlines current projects I am working on but have not yet completed. It is intended to showcase my most current work and to provide a sense of my current interests.

## Brain-Computer Interfacing Applied Semester Project
Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) is the use of measured brain activities an a signal to interact with a digital environment. In other words, thoughts are used as a "controller" in a digital environment. BCIs are a new and exciting field of research in neuroscience and I have had to privilege of volunteering with a lab at Dalhousie University that attempted to create one. Most BCIs use brain data collected using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG places electrodes on a person's scalp which read the summed electrical potential of the person's brain activity. 

As an Applied Semester Project at NSCC, I am working with one other student to compare two different statistical learning models applied to open-source EEG data. The paradigm asked participants to imagine a motor movement (e.g., squeezing their right hand) while their brain activity was measured, and classified the patterns as a signal to interact with the environment. The goal of the project is to  compare the use of Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines as classification models for this dataset and evaluate which method will provide more robust predictions. 

## Mental Wellness Database
Mental wellness is a psychological construct describing the healthiness of a person's mental state (as opposed to mental illness which typically lies on the low-end of a mental wellness spectrum). I am currently working on a project designing a relational database for a mental wellness evaluation. When the evaluation is filled out, the database will store the user's results and be used to provide an immediate visualization of their mental state, based on a five-dimensional model of mental wellness. The project is currently at a very early stage but requires the application of many skills I have learned from the Data Analytics program at NSCC and combines it with my education in psychology.

# Publications 
## [On Using Python to Run, Analyze, and Decode EEG Experiments](http://www.neurois.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Proceedings-Preprint.pdf "Link to NeuroIS Paper")
### Abstract:
As the NeuroIS field expands its scope to address more complex research questions with electroencephalography (EEG), there is greater need for
EEG analysis capabilities that are relatively easy to implement and adapt to different protocols, while at the same time providing an open and standardized approach. We present a series of open source tools, based on the Python programming language, which are designed to facilitate the development of open
and collaborative EEG research. As supplementary material, we demonstrate
the implementation of these tools in a NeuroIS case study and provide files that
can be adapted by others for NeuroIS EEG research.


## [Rethinking Time Course Data: Applications of Growth Curve Analysis in Spoken Word Recognition Research](https://scholar.acadiau.ca/islandora/object/theses%3A2187 "Link to Undergraduate Thesis Research Paper")

### Abstract:
Prominent models of spoken word recognition (SWR) make different predictions about the activation and deactivation of rhyme words. The present study used eye tracking to investigate differences in fixations to a target image (e.g., CONE) while being presented with various competitor images. Competitors were either cohorts (e.g., COMB), rhymes (e.g., BONE), or unrelated (e.g., GHOST) to the target stimulus. Traditional analyses of eye tracking data use generalized linear models to quantify differences in lexical competition across competitor sets while fixations may be better represented by curvilinear regression models. The present study compared growth curve analysis (GCA), a multilevel, curvilinear, hierarchical regression model compared to ANOVA, a generalized linear model, and compared results of the two analyses. As expected, it was found that cohorts reduced fixations to the target more than rhyme and unrelated competitor in both analyses at the linear level. Rhyme competitors reduced fixations to the target image at a linear level in both analyses but only when compared to a full competitor set. It is likely that full competitor set promotes eye movements to each competitor image and allows for the interference of a rhyme effect. Collectively, the results are taken as support for continuou mapping models (e.g., TRACE) of SWR. Future research should use GCA to explore fixations made directly to rhyme competitors as rhyme fixations have important clinical and practical applications.


## [Afterlife Legacies: The Pact](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/contributor/author/alex-sproul/ "Link to Chapters catalogue listing.")

This is a fantasy novel I wrote when I was 16 and published in Chapters, Indigo, and Coles locations across Canada. It is about the journey of five wolves who have passed on to the afterlife and their pursuit of the Kingdom: a better place for the ghosts of their world. The novel is 90,000 words long and was published after winning first place in the the Books for Kids by Kids competition by Bryler Publications in Chester, Nova Scotia. 

## [Bug Reports for APPLICATION_REDACTED](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/es5zzy/bug_reports_for_application_redacted/ "Link to Reddit Short Story")
This is a much more recent example of my creative writing. It is a science fiction suspense story about a QA tester filing bug reports for a predictive text application. Its capabilities become unsettling as the application makes accurate but important decisions for the user without the user's consent. The store received one platinum and two silver awards on Reddit's r/nosleep forum, received a 99% upvote rate, and has been requested to be performed on multiple podcasts.

# Independent Learning
## LinkedIn Learning Courses
### Learning GitHub and GitHub Essential Training
These two courses were a great introduction to using the command line to perform Git functions. I learned about conitnuous integration, change control structures, and how to use Git as an invaluable tool for project management.

### Data Science Foundations: Fundamentals
This course discussed different concepts in data science. The course explored career paths in data science and introduced a lot of the vocabulary used in data science at a high level. This course will be invaluable to me when communicating findings and concepts of data science to others.

### Managing Stress
Managing Stress is a short course outlining principles of how to deal with stressors in the workplace environment. I chose to include it here because it is soft skill that is essential to being a successful student and employee in a working environment.

### Learning vi and Learning Linux Command Line
Vi is a powerful text editor with a steep learning curve. For one of my courses at NSCC, I am learning to write scripts for Linux using vi. The notes I took from these two courses were very thorough and have proven to be an exceptional tool for me to refer back to as I continue to excel in that course.

### Learning PHP
PHP is an embedded programming language that provides interactivity to HTML web documents. I had never heard of PHP prior to taking this 7-hour course and also had limited experience in HTML. Learning PHP has been a fundamental resource for me learning to combine languages and finally piece together my knowledge of different languages, allowing them to work together to create more sophisticated projects. I look forward to learning more PHP and using it in the future to interact with databases.

## Matrix and Linear Algebra: Khan Academy
This year, I challenged myself to learn a new type of mathematics. Matrix and linear algebra is an essential skillset required for people with an interest in machine learning. For my Professional Practices in IT course, I chose to watch 100% of the videos on Khan Academy teaching this topic. I am extremely proud to have completed this course and feel much more confident in my ability to progress in my knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence as I continue to move forward with my education.
